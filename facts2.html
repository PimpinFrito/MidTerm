            The islands of Venice are connected together with over 400 bridges. Some more well known bridges, 
            such as the Burano are much farther away and reachable only by boat. Only four of those bridges
            cross the Grand Canal.

            In the city of Venice, there aren't any cars, at all. Boats and canals are used in place of cars and roads.
            Around 400 boats cross through the canals each day.
